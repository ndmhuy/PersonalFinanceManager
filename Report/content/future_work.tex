\section{Future Work}
While the Personal Finance Manager application meets the core requirements outlined in the project specification, there are several areas for potential enhancement and future development:
\subsection{Graphical User Interface (GUI)}
Transitioning from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface would significantly improve user experience. A
GUI could provide intuitive navigation, visual charts for financial data, and drag-and-drop functionality for managing transactions and wallets.
\subsection{Multi-User Support}
Implementing multi-user capabilities would allow different users to maintain separate financial records within the same application instance. This could involve user authentication, profile management, and data isolation. 
\subsection{Cloud Synchronization}
Adding cloud synchronization features would enable users to back up their data online and access it from multiple devices. This could involve integrating with cloud storage services or developing a custom backend server for data management.
\subsection{Mobile Application}
Developing a mobile version of the Personal Finance Manager would allow users to manage their finances on-the-go. A mobile app could leverage device features such as notifications for upcoming bills or expenses.
