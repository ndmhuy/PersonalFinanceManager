\section{Conclusion}
The Personal Finance Manager project successfully delivers a robust console application for tracking and managing personal finances. Through the implementation of custom data structures, a clear MVC architecture, and multi-threaded data persistence, the application meets its core objectives of reliability, usability, and cross-platform support. 
The layered design ensures that business logic is well-separated from the user interface, facilitating maintainability and test. 
The console UI, while simple, is thoughtfully designed with consistent menus, input validation, and clear feedback to enhance user experience.
Looking ahead, there are numerous opportunities for future enhancements, including the development of a graphical user interface, multi-user support, cloud synchronization, and mobile application versions. These potential improvements would further elevate the application's usability and accessibility, making it a more comprehensive tool for personal finance management.
